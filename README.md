**Overview:**
A simple Pac-Man web app game made using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and WebGL. The 2D graphics were rendered with custom vertex and fragment shaders created using WebGL. The goal is to get as high a score as possible before the 60-second game timer runs out. Each pellet gives 100 points, and getting hit by an enemy makes you lose 1000. The purple pellet is a power-up that lets you sustain a hit without losing points. The game ends if you lose all your points. Getting all the pellets before time runs out also gives you a point bonus of 100 multiplied by your time left. Enemies follow a pathfinding algorithm to chase and corner the player. Try beating your high scores and have fun!
