A simple Pac-Man web app game made using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and WebGL. The 2D graphics were rendered with custom vertex and fragment shaders that were created using WebGL. The goal of the game is to collect all yellow point pellets before the 60 sec game timer runs out. Each pellet gives 100 points and getting hit by an enemy makes you lose 1000. The purple pellet is a powerup that lets you sustain a hit without losing points. The game ends if you lose all your points. Enemies follow a pathfinding algorithm to chase and corner the player. To play, download the repository and open the html file.
